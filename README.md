# Unlucky fishing days
  A person went fishing for N days, and we know how much fish he caught each day.
Write a program that lists his unlucky days. A day is unlucky if he caught less than 5 pieces
of fish.

Input 
The first line of the standard input contains the count of days (1≤N≤100). The next
N lines each contain the fish caught on the given day (0≤Fi≤30).

Output 
The first line of the standard output should contain the count of unlucky days, and
then the indexes of those days in increasing order, separated by spaces
